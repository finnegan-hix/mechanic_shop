Mechanic_sho
Our application is a website aimed to be adjacent to a mechanics website where you can book appointments and if you are a reoccuring customer log in with an email and password. We used languages such as React and Javascript and packages such  as bootstrap, express, cors and sqlite3. We used React becuase we feel it is a versatile language and found it more fitting to write and application like this in it. We faced some interesting challenges in writing this project such as creating a user login, dealing with insufficient versions and deploying. The frontend was created by Joshua Cline and Gabriel Stevens and the backend was created by Leonel Lamelas and Finnegan Hix. Their github links will be provided below.
